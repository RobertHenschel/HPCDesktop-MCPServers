Now write a python qt app in the root directory that when run, shows all MCP servers and all "functions" they expose. The app knows about the MCP servers by parsing a json file that is located in teh same directory called available_mcps.json. Create that as well and put the slurm mcp in there. Designate the mcp by the python file to account for the possibility to have multipe mcp server per directory.
Also create a requirements.txt in the root.
Make the application icon ./Cray-1-AI.png. That is the icon that shows up when the user switches between apps using ALT-Tab in MATE.
Add a button to the app that allows execution of that function and shows the result in a new modal window.

======= Chatbot =======
Create a chatbot, by using the credentials available in config.dat.
Use python and qt again and give the chatbot access to all mcps that are listed
in available_mcps.json.
Do this work in the already available directory called qtchatbot.
Externalize important prompts that you are setting, like the system prompt.
So that I can easier edit those. 
Also create a requirements.txt file in that subdirectory
